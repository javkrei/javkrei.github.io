title: A rate counter in Go
---

As part of my algorithmic trading work I needed to count events within a moving time window. I looked for packages in Go implementing this functionality. I found a few that did sort of what I wanted:

https://github.com/prep/average
https://github.com/seiflotfy/count-min-log

However, I didn't like the fact that there was a minimum temporal resolution, so I decided to implement one that didn't have that limitation.
It works by initiating a timer for each event received, when the time window elapses the timer triggers and decreases the counter. 

Here is the github repo:

Additionaly it's possible to assign tags to events to count different types of events that occur.

Now let's see what we can do with this tool:

* count the number of miliseconds in a second
* count the number of nanoseconds in a second: we reach the limitation of the computer clock frequency
